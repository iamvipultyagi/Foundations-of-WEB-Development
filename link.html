    <h3>Introduction to Renewable Energy</h3>
    <p>
        Renewable energy sources are naturally replenishing forms of energy that provide sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. As the world grapples with climate change, these energy sources have become increasingly crucial for our planet's future.

    <h3>
        Major Types of Renewable Energy
    </h3>
    <h4>
        1. Solar Energy
    </h4>
    <p>
        Solar power harnesses the sun's energy through photovoltaic panels or concentrated solar systems. It's becoming increasingly affordable and efficient, making it one of the fastest-growing renewable sectors.
    </p>
    <h4>
        2. Wind Energy
    </h4>
    <p>
        Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from moving air into electricity. Both onshore and offshore wind farms are vital components of many countries' renewable energy strategies.
